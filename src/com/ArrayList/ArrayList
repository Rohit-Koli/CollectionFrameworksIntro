ArrayList :
	If we want to hetrogenious data then we can use only simple arrayList
	
	If we want to use homogenious data then we can use generic class  
	
	ArrayList extends abstract list class and implement list interface
	Duplicates are allowed 
	Insertion order is preserved
	hetrogenious is allowed to store
	Null insertion is possible
	Bydefault is non synchronized / thread safe
	
	This is how we can define arrayList :
		ArrayList ar = new ArrayList();
		ArrayList ar2 = new ArrayList(50);
		ArrayList ar3 = new ArrayList(ar);
