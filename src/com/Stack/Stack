Stack :
In Java, the Stack class is part of the Java Collections Framework 
and extends the Vector class. It represents a last-in, first-out (LIFO)
stack of objects. This means that the last element added to the stack
will be the first one to be removed. The Stack class provides several 
methods to manipulate the stack, such as pushing, popping, and peeking.

When to Use Stack:
	Backtracking Algorithms: Stacks are useful in algorithms that
	require backtracking,such as depth-first search (DFS) in graphs.
	
	Expression Evaluation: Stacks can be used to evaluate expressions,
	such as arithmetic expressions or balanced parentheses.
	
	Undo Mechanisms: Stacks can be used to implement undo mechanisms
	in applications, where each action is pushed onto the stack and 
	can be popped to undo it.
