Set Interface :
	Implements Hash table
		Hash Table:
		 	Key value Pairs 
	duplicate elements not allowed 
	Available in java.util package
	Heterogeneous data allowed
	Null insertion is allowed
	Implements serializable,clonable and Random access interface
	Insertion order is not preserved
	Its is non synchronized

LinkedHashSet
	Combination of linked list and Hashset
	Null insertion is allowed
	We cannot add Duplicate elements 
	Slower than hashset
	It is nonSynchronized
	efficient for insertion and Deletion
	We can call LinkedHashSet = LinkedList + HashSet
	
	We can create LinkedHashSet using set also 
	Following is the example of how can we declare the linkedHashSet
	Set<Integer> s = new LinkedHashSet<>();
		s.add(100);
		LinkedHashSet<Integer> lh = new LinkedHashSet<>();
		lh.add(10);

TreeSet :
	TreeSet is faster than arrayList & LinkedList when we have to Search and retrieval
	the element	but treeSet is slower in Insertion and deletion operation 
	HashMap and trees combinations is TreeSet
	Duplicate elements are not allowed
	Access and retrieval time is very slow
	NUll values not allowed
	TreeSet automatically sort's the data in ascending order
	Internally it implements treeMap 
	It is present in java.util package
	TreeSet in non synchronized it means non thread safe
	Only homogeneous data is allowed to Insert(Same type of data ) 
	We can make it synchronized.
		Example :Collections.synchronizedSet(Collection<>);
