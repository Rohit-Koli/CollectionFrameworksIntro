Map :
	Map is Separate interface a part of collections interface
	Store's data in a key Value pairs
	Introduced from 1.8 Version
	One to one mapping(One key for one data)
	We can Directly mention key and their values 
	Key   , Value
	Implementation of map is HashMap
	Duplicate data is not allowed
	Key should not be duplicate,Duplicate value is allowed but not the key
	Null data is allowed to insert
	
Linked HashMap:
	Combination of LinkedList and HashMap
	It implements HashTable
	It Contains only unique values
	Linked HashMap is non synchronized
	It allows only one null key,but values can have multiple null values 
	It initial capacity is 16
	Load factor is 0.75 
	It maintains insertion order	
	
	Aquires more memory
	Slower than HashMap
	
	Uses of LinkedHashMap
		To add values in contineous manner
		TO use functionality's of HashMap with LinkedList
		When we have no bound of Execution speed
		
TreeMap:
	TreeMap is child of SortedMap and Map class interface
	Implements data structure TreeMap
	It contains only unique element's
	TreeMap is non Synchronized(NOt thread Safe)
	We cannot put null key value ,but multiple null values 

Weak HashMap
	Garbage collector may remove null keys and associated
	Allow only one null key , and allow multiple duplicate values
	Does not allow duplicate keys
	Non Synchronized
	Default size is 16 
	Load factor is 0.75
	Does not store 
	TO clear memory in efficient way by the use of GarbageCollecot (System.gc())
